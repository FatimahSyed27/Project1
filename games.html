    <h1> Favorite Games </h1>
    <p>Here are a few video games and board games that I enjoy.</p>
		
    <h2> Call of Duty </h2>	
    <p>This video game series consist of Modern Warfare, Warzone, Black Ops, and more. You battle against human opponents using different weapons
	    and the last team or player surviving the game wins. 
	    
     <h2> Ludo </h2>
     <p> Ludo is a very intense strategy board game with a minimum of two players and a maximum of four players. There's a path that leads clockwise around the board, 
	     and your job is to get all your tokens "home" without being killed.</p>
     <p> Check out the video below to learn how to play Ludo!</p>

     <h2> Monopoly </h2>
     <p>I'm sure you all heard of Monopoly, which is a multi-player game that lets you buy and trade properties throughout the board. 
	     The goal is to remain financially stable and cause other opponents to go into bankruptcy. Whoever has the most money wins!</p>
